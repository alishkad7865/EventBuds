# EventBuds

## Project idea
Developing cross platform Event Planning and Management mobile application using react native, which allows collaboration of multiple helpers to complete the event tasks.

## Project background/Business Opportunity
There are many event planning or event management applications and websites for either planning an event or going to an event. However, there are none that show nearby public events and creating and managing your own private events. Our application allows creating public and private events and adding helpers to finish tasks for the event and keeping everyone notified. Some of the features include adding events and tasks, progress updates, Live event tracker, and invitees response and schedule.
