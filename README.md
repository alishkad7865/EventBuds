# EventBuds

## Project idea

Developing cross platform Event Planning and Management which allows collaboration of multiple helpers to complete the event and its tasks.

## Project background/Business Opportunity

There are many event planning or event management applications and websites for either planning an event or going to an event. However we couldn't find any free application that show nearby public events, creating events and managing your own private events. Our application allows creating public and private events, adding helpers to finish tasks for the event and keeping everyone notified.

### Some of the Key features includes:
- Create your event.
- Invite friends your event.
- Assign tasks (e.g. Bring Cake)
- Track each taskâ€™s status
- Browse public events.
- View all the upcoming events you are part of in the same spot.
